You can play the game directly by downloading the pre-built executable (executable/MusicJump.exe) in our repository.

Or, the following steps require installation of Unity:

First, install Unity version 2019.2.11 from the following site: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive.

You will also have to install Unity Hub and generate a free license.

You can then clone our repository in Unity, then go to File > Build and Run, which should allow you to play the game.
